# Student Time Management System
Most students constantly feel under pressure. They typically feel that they don't have sufficient time to
keep up with their coursework, complete their assignments, and study for tests and exams. Often they
lack the skills to adequately manage their time, or they perceive implementing a time management
system as being unnecessarily administratively cumbersome. So the proposed Student Time Management
System will automate much of the work for them and simplify the process. It should allow students to
document their academic deadlines for assignments and tests (on a monthly or semester basis), specify a
weekly study planner (identifying time for studying), and manage a daily to do list. Based on this
information, it should advise students about how they should productively spend their time, so e.g. today
you should be completing your MAM1000W Assignment due on Thursday and studying for the
CSC1015F PracTest on Friday. The system should be web-based so students can access it from
anywhere, and possibly also a mobile application to increase access.
